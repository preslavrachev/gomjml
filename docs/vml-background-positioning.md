Why does VML position mapping for center produce different decimal values in different contexts - specifically why does background-position="center center" result in VML position="0, 0" instead of position="0.5, 0.5"?

Because MJML has to translate CSS background-position into VML, and VML uses two different positioning models depending on whether the image is tiled or framed (no‑repeat). In the code, if background-repeat = repeat (VML type="tile"), percentages are converted directly to decimals: 50% → 0.5, so center center becomes position="0.5, 0.5". But when background-repeat = no-repeat (VML type="frame"), Outlook’s VML “frame” positioning interprets the numbers as offsets from the image’s center relative to the box, not normalized 0–1 anchors. MJML compensates by shifting the percentage by −0.5: value = (percent/100) − 0.5. Thus 50% becomes 0 (50% − 50% = 0), left/top (0%) becomes −0.5, right/bottom (100%) becomes 0.5. That ensures the visual result in Outlook matches standard CSS centering and edge alignment. So center center intentionally maps to 0,0 in no-repeat mode. If you want 0.5,0.5 you must be in repeat (tiled) mode; otherwise the adjustment is required for correct rendering.
